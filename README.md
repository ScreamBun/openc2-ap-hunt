## OASIS TC Open Repository: openc2-ap-hunt

This GitHub public repository [openc2-ap-hunt](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-hunt) was created at the request of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

## Statement of Purpose

This specification defines an actuator profile to automate management of cyber threat hunting activities using OpenC2. Threat hunting is the process of proactively and iteratively searching through networks and on endpoints to detect and isolate cyber observables that may indicate threats that evade existing security solutions. This actuator profile defines the OpenC2 Actions, Targets, Arguments, and Specifiers along with conformance clauses to enable the operation of OpenC2 Producers and Consumers in the context of cyber threat hunting. It covers invocation of stored hunting processes (e.g., “hunt books”), passing of hunt parameters, selection of analytics to apply to hunt data, and the expected type(s) and format(s) of information returned by hunting processes.
